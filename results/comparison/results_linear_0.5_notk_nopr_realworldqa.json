    "linear_0.5_notk_nopr_result": "C. Right\n\nThe front wheel of the car on the right side is facing to the right. This is because the car is moving along the right side of the street, and the front wheel is pointing in the direction of travel. The image shows the car on the right side of the crosswalk, and the front wheel is turned to the right, indicating that the car is moving forward. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Right. \n\nThe other options are incorrect because the front wheel is not facing left (A) or straight (B). It is facing right, which is the direction of the car's movement. So, the correct answer is C. Right. \n\nI hope this helps clarify the direction of the front wheel.
