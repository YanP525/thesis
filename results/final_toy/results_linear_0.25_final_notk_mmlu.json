    "question": " Which tradition is known to promote \"gradual enlightenment\"?",
    "answer": 3,
    "linear_0.25_final_notk_result": "The tradition which promotes \"gradual enlightenment\" is Shinto.\n\nShinto is a traditional Japanese religion that seeks to find the divine in everything. Its focus is on spiritual development, aiming at promoting harmony in one's daily life through the practice of rituals, prayer, and other spiritual activities. Shinto does not promote the idea of an instant or sudden enlightenment but rather gradual enlightenment through practice and dedication.\n\nOn the other hand, some Buddhist traditions, like Nichiren Buddhism, emphasize the path of practice known as \"Daily Buddhist Practice,\" which is intended to lead to enlightenment in this very lifetime through the recitation of the Daimoku (Namu Myōhō Renge Kyō). Soto Zen is another Buddhist school that also practices zazen meditation and other forms of daily practice to cultivate mindfulness and insight, which can lead to enlightenment.\n\nHowever, both Nichiren and Soto Zen also acknowledge that the journey to enlightenment requires effort, patience, and practice and do not necessarily promote the idea of instant or sudden enlightenment, but they do have differing takes on how enlightenment is achieved. Nichiren focuses on chanting for protection and to attain enlightenment, while Soto Zen emphasizes the cultivation of the mind through zazen meditation.\n\nBushido is the code of conduct followed by samurai warriors in Japan, which emphasizes personal loyalty, courage, and discipline. It is not specifically a spiritual or religious tradition focused on enlightenment.\n\nSo, considering the option, the correct answer is 0. Bushido is known for promoting \"gradual enlightenment.\""
