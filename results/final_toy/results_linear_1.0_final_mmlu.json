    "question": " When was the first Buddhist temple constructed in Japan?",
    "answer": 3,
    "linear_1.0_final_result": "The first Buddhist temple in Japan was constructed in the early 6th century. Specifically, it is believed that the **Horyu-ji Temple**, located in Nara, was the first Buddhist temple built in Japan.

    "answer": 3,
    "linear_1.0_final_result": "In Japanese religious and philosophical traditions, the concept of \"gradual enlightenment\" is often associated with **Buddhism**, particularly within the **Meditation School** traditions. However, looking at the specific options provided:\n\n- **Bushido**: While associated with samurai ethics and related to Shinto, it does not specifically promote \"gradual enlightenment.\"\n- **Shinto**: Shinto typically emphasizes sudden enlightenment through the recognition of the divine within oneself, rather than a gradual process.\n- ** Nichiren Buddhism**: Nichiren promotes sudden enlightenment (\"Kenshō\"), often through the practice of meditation and reciting the Nichiren Lotus Sutra.\n- **Sōto Zen**: Sōto Zen also emphasizes sudden enlightenment (\"satori\") through zazen meditation.\n\nIf we interpret \"gradual enlightenment\" as implying a process over time, none of the options directly associate with that. However, **Tendai** and **Nichiren** do have elements of gradual study and practice, though they often emphasize sudden realization as well.\n\n### Answer:\n1. **Shinto**\n   \nThe practice of Shinto does not typically promote gradual enlightenment, as it often focuses on the recognition of divine truth (or kami) through rituals and devotion rather than a progressive path.
