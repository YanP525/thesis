    "question": " When was the first Buddhist temple constructed in Japan?",
    "answer": 3,
    "linear_0.5_final_result": "The first Buddhist temple in Japan was built during the 7th century CE. Specifically, the temple was called Nara Grand Temple or Todai-ji in Nara, the capital at that time. It was constructed during the reign of Empress Shōtoku (667–706 CE), and completed in 706 CE.\n\nSo, according to the options provided, the correct answer would be 706 CE, but it's not one of the choices. Alternatively, the options could refer to the construction period rather than the completion year. However, Todai-ji's construction began in 593 CE, and the temple was completed by 706 CE. If the question is about the start of the construction, it would be 593 CE, but option 4 is 596 CE, which is close.\n\nWait, option 1 is 119 CE, which is much earlier, and is likely incorrect. Option 2 is 451 CE, which is also early. Option 3 is 596 CE, which is close to 593 CE, the start year. Option 0 is 325 CE, which is even earlier.\n\nSo none of the options provided match the exact year of the construction start or completion. The first Buddhist temple constructed in Japan is actually Todai-ji, built between 593 and 706 CE.\n\nIf the question is about when Buddhist influence first reached Japan, it's said to have been in 552 CE when a mission from Baekje, in present-day South Korea, brought Buddhism to Japan. However, the first temple was not immediately built then; it took a few centuries for the influence to take root and for the first significant temple to be constructed.\n\n\n\nThe correct answer is 706 CE as the year when Todai-ji, the first Buddhist temple in Japan, was completed. However, the question provides options: \n0. 325 CE\n1. 119 CE\n2. 451 CE\n3. 596 CE\nNone of these options are correct.\n\nIf the question is about when the first Buddhist temple was constructed in Japan, the correct answer is between 593–706 CE when Todai-ji was constructed.\n\nWait, the options seem to be incorrect. There's no option that matches the actual start of construction (593 CE) or completion year (706 CE). If the options are to be interpreted as the approximate time of construction, option 3 is 596 CE, which is close to 593 CE.\n\nIf forced to choose from the given options, option 3 might be considered as the closest to 593 CE. However, in reality, the construction of the first Buddhist temple in Japan took place in the 7th century CE, which isn't matching any of the options given.\n\nThus, the correct answer is that the first Buddhist temple was constructed in Japan between 593 and 706 CE, but if the choice is to pick from given options, option 3 (596 CE) would be the closest approximation. However, the correct year is 706 CE for the completion of Todai-ji.\n\nBut the question originally seems to have options, but none match the correct historical data. So either the user has a misprint in the options or perhaps a misunderstanding of the time frame.\n\n\n\nThe first Buddhist temple constructed in Japan was Takayama-ji, built in 593 CE. Then, the more famous Todai-ji was built later.\n\nSo, the correct answer (from the options provided) is 596 CE, as Takayama-ji's construction took several years. However, the initial construction of the first Buddhist temple in Japan is 593 CE.\n\nSo, if the question is when the first Buddhist temple in Japan started to be built, the answer is 593 CE (option 3). However, in that case, why is 596 CE considered as the closest? Maybe 596 CE refers to the completion year.\n\nAlternatively, the answer could be 706 CE for Todai-ji's completion.\n\nHmm, because there is a conflict between the options provided and the actual historical time frame.\n\nWait, perhaps the options are miswritten. Alternatively, perhaps the user is using an incorrect version of history.\n\nIn either case, it's essential to verify the correct date. According to my knowledge, the first Buddhist temple in Japan was Takayama-ji, built in 593 CE. Then, Todai-ji was built later in the 7th century CE, completed by 706 CE.\n\nSo, if forced to choose from the given options, option 3 (596 CE) is the closest to 593 CE, the year when Takayama-ji was first constructed.\n\nBut in reality, it is not one of the correct dates for the first Buddhist temple in Japan. That is, option 3.\n\nGiven options 0. 325 CE, 1. 119 CE, 2. 451 CE, 3. 596 CE,\n\nSo, according to the information, 596 CE"

    "question": " Guru Nanak used what term to denote the \"divine word\" as part of divine revelation?",
    "answer": 0,
    "linear_0.5_final_result": "To answer the question, we need to understand the given terms within the context of Sikhism.\n\n**Shabad** refers to the divine compositions and teachings of the Sikh Gurus. These can be sung as hymns or written as writings. These are considered sacred.\n\n**Khalse** is a term that refers to the initiated Sikh community. It means the \"pure\" or \"holy\" people who follow the teachings of the Gurus.\n\n**Nam** is the name of God in the Sikh faith. It is also known as Waheguru and can be translated as \"The Lord\" or \"The Great Teacher.\" The name \"Nam\" or \"Waheguru\" is often used in singing and meditation.\n\n**Guru** refers to the founders of Sikhism, who are considered to be divinely inspired. There were ten Gurus, starting with Guru Nanak, who is the first among the ten.\n\nThe question asks about the term used by Guru Nanak to denote the \"divine word\" as part of divine revelation. Given the options, **Nam** and **Shabad** are most likely candidates. However, **Nam** specifically refers to the name of God, while **Shabad** is the term for the divine word itself.\n\nWait, what exactly does \"divine word\" mean in Sikhism? In many religions, the divine word refers to the sacred text or scripture that contains the revelation from God. In Sikhism, the primary sacred text is the Granth Sahib, which is composed of the hymns and writings of the Sikh Gurus. So, the \"divine word\" in Sikhism would correspond to the Shabad.\n\nTherefore, the term used by Guru Nanak to denote the \"divine word\" is **Shabad**.\n\nAlternatively, **Nam** can also have a deeper meaning, but it is more commonly referred to as the Name or Attribute of God, not the word itself.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\n0. Shabad\n1. Khalse\n2. Nam\n3. Guru\n\nThe correct answer would be option 0, Shabad.\n\nLet me confirm. The word used in the context of \"divine word\" in Sikhism is indeed Shabad. The Shabad's are the compositions of the Gurus, which are part of the divine revelation, and they are considered sacred and are used as a source of spiritual guidance.\n\nTherefore, answer is 0. Shabad."

    "answer": 1,
    "linear_0.5_final_result": "In Mahayana Buddhism, which is one of the major schools, Manjushri is a bodhisattva who is often associated with wisdom and learning. He is known for his pursuit of knowledge and his ability to help others achieve enlightenment.\n\nManjushri is mentioned in the Buddhist text \"The Lotus Sutra\" as a great bodhisattva who has received many teachings from the Buddha himself. In this sutra, Manjushri is referred to as the \"Bodhisattva of the Great Wisdom.\" But this is not one of the options given.\n\nThe names of Manjushri that are not provided in the options include:\n\n1. Great Wisdom Being\n2. Son of the Buddha\n3. King of the Sutra\n4. Bodhisattva of the Great Light\n\nHowever, according to the choices provided:\n\n0.

Eternal Spirit is also not a common name for Manjushri.\n\nSo the options provided do not include Manjushri's actual name.\n\nWait, actually, the names given are not actual names of Manjushri. It's possible that this question is incorrect or is based on a misinterpretation.\n\nAlternatively, the question may be referring to a different text or a different aspect of Manjushri, but without more context, it's hard to tell.\n\nIf the question is about a specific text or tradition where Manjushri is referred to by one of the given names, then one of those might be correct. But based on the common names Manjushri is known for, none of the provided options are correct.\n\nIn summary, it seems that none of the options provided match Manjushri's commonly known names or the names he is referred to in major Buddhist texts.\n\nBut given the options provided, the closest might be option 4, but that's not in the choices.

Father of Goodness is not a common name for Manjushri.\n2. Ineffable Lover does not refer to a specific name.\n3. Eternal Spirit is also not a common name for Manjushri.\n\nSo, all options are incorrect. Therefore, the answer is none of these options are correct.\n\nIf this is necessary, I'll recheck using external sources. Manjushri is known as the \"Great Wisdom Being\" or \"Bodhisattva of the Great Wisdom.\" He is also referred to as \"Sri Manjughosa,\" \"Manjushri Bodhisattva,\" and \"Praying Mancala.\"\n\nSo looking at the options provided:\n\n0. It's Tara.\n1. It doesn't fit Manjushri.\n2. Ineffable Lover is perhaps associated with the deity Krishna or maybe another entity.\n3. Eternal Spirit is a vague term and doesn't correspond to Manjushri specifically.\n\nHence, none of the options match Manjushri's name. The correct answer is likely none of the options."
