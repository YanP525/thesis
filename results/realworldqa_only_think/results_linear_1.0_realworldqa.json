But this is getting beyond my capacity because of the distance.\n\nPerhaps I should think about the distance which is an ideal scenario, maximum step, maximum steps with minimal impact.\n\nBut no, I'm not getting to, because of the multiple steps. But in this problem, it's a big one, the distance is much.\n\nWait, another thought: the distance is of a certain order. So for the maximum steps, it's 1n steps, which is n(n) something). Wait, no. because each step with increase, until that maximum.\n\nWait, no, that's because each step adds to the total movement distance, which is, (V × T ) but no, better in thinking.\n\nWait, but the distance is not clear.\n\nNo, Let's think again.\n\nThe distance was a variable to max but that becomes minimal because of the steps.\n\nWait, no, because the maximum step is the maximum allowed step, which is 1 step.\n\nWait, no, the maximum number of steps.\n\nWait, perhaps that is a higher number than 1 for the maximum step.\n\nWait, no, because the maximum step is 1 for the minimal steps.\n\nWait.

No. Because I think it's based on another function.\n\nWait, perhaps it's stopping here. because the maximum steps is 1.\n\nBut the process is more complicated, as you have to go through several steps to get to the maximum displacement.\n\nWait, but I think.\n\nWait. no. another thought.\n\nPerhaps I should stop thinking, because the steps are getting too involved.\n\nWait, perhaps it's making it too complicated.\n\nWait, no. another thought.\n\nBut, maybe I can express the solution.\n\nWait, but the steps are the function of distance.\n\nBut the problem is of a distance with an unknown.\n\nPerhaps, no. the distance is known.\n\nWhich, I think.
