pickup truck is positioned near the center of the lane.\n\nThe nearest curb is the one adjacent to the lane where the truck is driving.\n\nAssuming the lane width is standard, approximately:\n\nThe distance between the truck's position and the nearest curb would be half the lane width.\n\nGiven that lane widths vary but are typically around:\n\n- 3 meters in some countries\n- 3.5 meters in others\n\nLet's assume a standard lane width of approximately:\n\n3 meters.\n\nSo the distance between the truck and the nearest curb would be:\n\n3 meters divided by two:\n\n1.5 meters.\n\nBut the options provided are:\n\nA. 5.5 meters\n\nB. 9.5 meters\n\nC. 13.5 meters\n\nNone of these options match the calculation.\n\nWait...\n\nPerhaps the image is scaled differently?\n\nIf the image is scaled such that:\n\n- The distance between the truck and the nearest curb is scaled proportionally.\n\nThen:\n\nIf the actual distance is:\n\n1.5 meters,\n\nThen:\n\nA scaled distance would

scaling factor or actual lane width, it's impossible to determine the correct answer.\n\nIf you have more context or information about the scaling factor or lane width, perhaps you could adjust the calculation accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, if you have access to the original image dimensions or scaling information, you could calculate the distance more accurately.\n\nBut without that
