    "linear_0.25_final_notk_result": "Without specific scale, I can't determine the exact distance. But if the truck is on the highway and its position is relative to the curb on the side of the road, it depends on how often it's passing or how far it is from the median. Based on the image, there is a truck positioned near the median of the highway, which is in the middle of the road. Therefore, it's the same distance from both curbs. So the horizontal distance from the truck to the curb would be the same as the distance from the truck to the median. A median is typically located in the middle of the highway, which splits the road into two lanes going in opposite directions. That would be the furthest point from which either curb is. Therefore, the horizontal distance to both curbs is equal to the distance between the truck and the median.\n\nHowever, without a specific scale, it's impossible to determine the exact length in meters. It's also important to note that distance from the truck to the median may not be the same in all sections of the highway, if lanes can merge or diverge. Given this, it seems that I can't provide a definite answer based on the image.",
